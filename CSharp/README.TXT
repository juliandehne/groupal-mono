CSharp Implementation of GroupAL (group formation algorithm)

Last update of readme: 05/06/2014


How to start:
- Open the VisualStudio Solution
- Begin with the (short) MainWindow.xaml.cs
  it basically only creates an instance of GroupALUsage.cs (which you should further refer to)
- Open GroupALUsage.cs, which is a good start to see a possible application/usage of the algorithm. It contains several dummy/example-methods showing how to use the flexibility of the GroupAL components in combination (e.g. for runtime analysis or comparison or simply only to create learning groups, parameterize each participant and write out the results)...of course you can as well access the objects of build groups/cohorts directly (instead of writing to disk) to identify members and process them further in your code.)
